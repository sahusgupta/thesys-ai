Week 1:
📂 Step 1: Implement AI Summarization & Research Processing
📁 models/summarization_model.py
Purpose: AI-driven text summarization of research papers, articles, and documents.

🔹 File Breakdown (What Needs to Be Done)
1️⃣ Define Summarization Model

Select LLM (GPT-4, Llama 2, BART, Pegasus, or T5).
Implement abstractive vs. extractive summarization options.
Support multi-document summarization for research synthesis.
2️⃣ Preprocess Input Text

Implement document segmentation (breaking large documents into chunks).
Perform tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
Convert scanned PDFs into machine-readable text.
3️⃣ Generate Summary

Use NLP models to create a structured summary with:
🔹 Key Findings
🔹 Methodologies
🔹 Contradictions/Limitations
Adapt summary depth based on user preference (brief vs. detailed).
4️⃣ Return Summarized Output

Convert the AI-generated summary into a structured JSON response.
Store summaries in FAISS/Pinecone for fast retrieval.
📁 models/document_parser.py
Purpose: Extract readable text from PDFs, HTML articles, and scanned documents.

🔹 File Breakdown (What Needs to Be Done)
1️⃣ Extract Text from Various Document Types

Support PDFs, HTML articles, Word docs, and plain text files.
Use PyMuPDF (PDF parsing) & BeautifulSoup (HTML parsing).
2️⃣ Implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Convert scanned PDFs & images into searchable text.
Use Tesseract OCR or EasyOCR to extract data from non-machine-readable sources.
3️⃣ Clean & Preprocess Extracted Text

Remove boilerplate content (headers, footers, ads, page numbers).
Perform sentence segmentation to break large texts into readable paragraphs.
4️⃣ Store Parsed Text in Vector Database

Convert text into vector embeddings (FAISS/Pinecone) for semantic search & retrieval.
📁 backend/query_pipeline.py
Purpose: Handles research query execution, routing input to AI models, and structuring the output.

🔹 File Breakdown (What Needs to Be Done)
1️⃣ Receive User Query & Document Input

Accept input via API (from frontend) or CLI (for local testing).
Validate input: Ensure proper file format, text length, and research topic.
2️⃣ Pass Query to AI Summarization Model

Retrieve relevant documents from FAISS/Pinecone.
Generate summarization request and send to models/summarization_model.py.
3️⃣ Return Processed Research Output

Format AI summary into a structured JSON response.
Attach metadata (source details, confidence scores).
Return AI-generated structured report to API/frontend.
📂 Step 2: Implement AI Citation Generation
📁 models/citation_model.py
Purpose: Automatically generate properly formatted citations (APA, MLA, IEEE, Chicago).

🔹 File Breakdown (What Needs to Be Done)
1️⃣ Extract Key Citation Data

Retrieve author name, title, publication year, source URL, DOI.
If missing, query CrossRef API & Google Scholar API to fetch missing metadata.
2️⃣ Format Citation Based on Style Guide

Convert extracted data into APA, MLA, IEEE, or custom user-defined format.
Implement BibTeX conversion for academic export.
3️⃣ Return Formatted Citation

Ensure correct punctuation & capitalization.
Convert into JSON output for API.
📁 backend/citation_generator.py
Purpose: Calls citation_model.py and formats citations based on research papers, books, and online articles.

🔹 File Breakdown (What Needs to Be Done)
1️⃣ Accept Citation Request

Receives raw citation data or document metadata.
Validates document type (book, journal, website, conference paper).
2️⃣ Generate Citation

Calls models/citation_model.py to format proper APA/MLA/IEEE citation.
3️⃣ Return Properly Structured Citation

Outputs citation in JSON + BibTeX format.
Allows exporting citations as a reference list.
📂 Step 3: Implement AI Fact-Checking
📁 models/factcheck_model.py
Purpose: Cross-checks AI-generated information against verified sources and flags potential misinformation.

🔹 File Breakdown (What Needs to Be Done)
1️⃣ Retrieve Fact-Checking Data

Query Semantic Scholar, CrossRef, Wikipedia, FactCheck.org.
Web scrape news sources, peer-reviewed journals, and Wikipedia pages.
2️⃣ Score Credibility of Sources

Assign a confidence score based on:
🔹 Peer-reviewed vs. Blog article
🔹 Publication recency
🔹 Reputation of the journal/site
3️⃣ Detect Bias & Inconsistencies

Run sentiment analysis to detect political or corporate bias.
Highlight contradictory information across sources.
4️⃣ Return Verified Research Output

Tag information accuracy as ✅ Verified, ⚠️ Contradictory, or ❌ Misleading.
Provide recommended alternative sources for conflicting claims.
📁 backend/factcheck_pipeline.py
Purpose: Handles fact-checking workflow, ensuring all AI-generated research is cross-verified before being returned to the user.

🔹 File Breakdown (What Needs to Be Done)
1️⃣ Process User Query

Accepts AI-generated summaries & extracts key claims.
2️⃣ Run AI Fact-Checking

Calls models/factcheck_model.py to verify research.
If contradictions detected, generates warning report.
3️⃣ Return Verified Research Output

Sends fact-checked, source-verified research summary to frontend.
Marks trust levels with appropriate labels (✅ Verified, ⚠️ Needs Review, ❌ Contradictory).
