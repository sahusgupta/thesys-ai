🚀 Thesys: AI-Powered Research Assistant
Hackathon Submission for Fetch.ai AI Agents Hackathon
🔥 Innovative, AI-driven multi-agent research assistant leveraging Fetch.ai’s ecosystem for real-time research automation, fact-checking, and citation generation.

📌 Overview
Thesys is an intelligent research assistant that automates document summarization, fact verification, citation generation, and knowledge retrieval by integrating Fetch.ai's Agentverse with advanced AI models.

💡 What Makes Thesys Unique?
✅ Multi-Agent Research Workflow – Fetch.ai-based AI Agents collaborate dynamically.
✅ Real-Time Fact-Checking – Ensures information credibility & bias detection.
✅ Adaptive Summarization – AI adjusts summary depth based on user needs.
✅ AI-Powered Citation Generation – Automatically formats references (APA, MLA, IEEE).
✅ Fetch.ai Search & Discovery Integration – Enables interaction with specialized research agents.

🎯 Key Features & Architecture
🔹 1️⃣ Multi-Agent Research Workflow (Fetch.ai + LLMs)
🚀 What Makes It Unique:

Unlike standard research assistants, Thesys collaborates with multiple AI Agents dynamically.
Uses Fetch.ai’s Agentverse to connect with specialized agents for fact-checking, data retrieval, academic citation, and summarization.
💡 Execution:

User submits a research query or uploads a document.
Thesys activates the following Fetch.ai Agents:
Scholar Agent: Fetches academic papers & research reports.
FactCheck Agent: Cross-verifies information across credible databases (Semantic Scholar, CrossRef, Google Fact Check).
Context Agent: Enhances research by providing historical, industry-specific, or scientific background.
Citation Agent: Generates formatted citations (APA, MLA, IEEE) dynamically.
Agents collaborate & return a fully synthesized, AI-validated research summary.
🔧 Tech Stack:
✅ Fetch.ai’s uAgents Framework (for multi-agent interactions).
✅ LangChain + Autogen (for agent coordination).
✅ CrossRef API + Google Scholar API (for academic data retrieval).

📑 2️⃣ Real-Time Fact-Checking & Source Ranking
🚀 What Makes It Unique:

Most AI tools blindly generate content without checking credibility.
Thesys validates every claim in real-time by dynamically ranking sources.
💡 Execution:

User submits a research topic or pastes content.
Thesys scans multiple sources & ranks them based on:
Credibility (Peer-reviewed journals > Wikipedia > News sites).
Bias detection (Left/right-wing media, corporate interests).
Publication recency & citation count.
AI highlights any inconsistencies & suggests corrections.
🔧 Tech Stack:
✅ Web Scraping: Scrapy + BeautifulSoup (for real-time data fetching).
✅ Bias Analysis: OpenAI GPT-4 fine-tuned with media credibility scoring.
✅ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Ensures AI only uses verified information.

📝 3️⃣ Adaptive Summarization (Not Just GPT Summaries)
🚀 What Makes It Unique:

Unlike basic GPT-based summarization, Thesys adapts output style & depth based on the research type.
Uses multi-layered synthesis—AI doesn’t just summarize, it contextualizes.
💡 Execution:

User specifies research type:
Scientific Paper → Detailed technical summary
Business Report → Executive-style summary
Legal Case → Bullet-point analysis
Thesys processes document & generates:
Structured insights (Key findings, methodology, contradictions).
AI-generated Q&A for further exploration.
Thesys then refines the output through interaction with Fetch.ai Agents.
🔧 Tech Stack:
✅ SpaCy + NLTK + GPT-4 API (for NLP-based summarization).
✅ FAISS + Pinecone (for document segmentation & retrieval).
✅ Fetch.ai Agent Integration (to cross-check document data).

📚 4️⃣ AI Research Report Generator (Structured PDF Output)
🚀 What Makes It Unique:

Users don’t just get summaries—they receive a structured AI-generated research report.
AI auto-generates formatted documents based on the user’s topic & academic level.
💡 Execution:

User enters topic → Thesys searches & organizes relevant sources.
AI generates a structured PDF research report:
Title Page (AI-generated)
Abstract (Summarized findings)
Body (Section-based breakdown)
AI-generated citations & bibliography
User receives report as PDF/Word & editable research workspace.
🔧 Tech Stack:
✅ LaTeX + Pandoc (for academic PDF generation).
✅ PyMuPDF + DocxWriter (for dynamic document formatting).
✅ **Fetch.ai Agent Integration for knowledge refinement.

🔗 5️⃣ Fetch.ai Agentverse Search & Discovery Integration
🚀 What Makes It Unique:

Judges expect Fetch.ai integration—Thesys goes beyond by making AI research collaborative.
Instead of just generating research from pre-built sources, Thesys lets users discover AI Agents that specialize in their topic.
💡 Execution:

User submits research topic → Thesys searches Agentverse for relevant AI Agents.
Thesys dynamically connects with:
AI-powered investment research agents (for financial topics).
Medical research agents (for healthcare topics).
Legal AI agents (for case law analysis).
**AI continuously updates its research findings based on new Fetch.ai discoveries.
🔧 Tech Stack:
✅ Fetch.ai SDK + uAgents (for discovering & interacting with AI Agents).
✅ FastAPI Backend (for handling multi-agent queries).
✅ FAISS + Pinecone (for intelligent knowledge retrieval).
